      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
      My name is Goodness Ojonuba I'm currently enrolled in Altschool Tinyuka
      2023 Semester with<strong>student ID number: ALT/SOE/023/2200.</strong> I
      graduated from the Federal University of Technology Minna with a degree
      in Industrial Technology Education and im a serving corp member in Fct.
      </p>
      <p>
      Have had this natural love for computers right from a young age
      and i have always nurse this desire to go into Tech full time. my frist
      attempt at learning to program came in 2021, i was learnig to code on my
      own without any real structure or a comunity and i ended up in tutorial
      hell. ALX offered me structure and steered me in the right direction but
      had to drop out as it was getting extremly difficult to combine daily
      task with school activities especially in my final year. Altschool
      provides me a fresh chance at becoming a software engineer and i intend
      to give it my best shot.
