          "No matter what happens or how bad it seems today, life does go on and it will be better tomorrow"

          "Learning to program is more than acquiring a skill; it is an expedition into the uncharted territories of your own potential.
           As you embark on this journey, remember that every error is not a setback but a stepping stone, guiding you towards mastery. In the realm of programming, mistakes are not flaws; 
           they are opportunities to unravel the mysteries of problem-solving."
